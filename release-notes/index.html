<h2 id="111-build-1717">1.1.1 (Build 1717)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2018-07-26</em></p>
<p>It's been two weeks since our initial public launch, and one week since we opened up to all countries. Thanks to everyone's feedback we have some minor changes and bug fixes for you in this update.</p>
<p>We made some changes to autolocking and want your help testing it! Please let us know if you find anything unexpected.</p>
<p>We also added Klar as a browser option instead of Focus, when available. Can all you German users with Klar installed please make sure it works OK?</p>
<p>Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The autolock timer pauses when on a webpage so it doesn't lock when submitting feedback or reading FAQs</li>
<li>Updated the app icon to an improved version</li>
<li>You can pick Klar as your preferred browser (instead of Focus) if its available on your device</li>
<li>We added the app version to the settings screen and feedback survey so we can know what you're running</li>
<li>Fixed a visual bug on the "Preferred Browser" table</li>
<li>Added ability to "Lock Now" for users without a device passcode set</li>
<li>Added more autolock timer options: 15 and 30 minutes</li>
<li>Fixed a Firefox Account bug related to server configuration</li>
<li>Fixed it so you return to the "Confirm Your Email" state and screen even if your app fully quits instead of starting everything over</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note: we intentionally skipped from version 1.0 all the way to 1.1.1 for various reasons.</p>

<p>We also show the app version number in the settings screen and add it the feedback survey so folks can easily tell us which version of the app they're using.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added more autolock timer options: 15 and 30 minutes</li>

<p><em>Date: 2018-05-18</em></p>
<p>What's NEW? We squashed a bunch of bugs (timed locking works much better now) and added a few improvements (user-friendly titles and a sync indicator that doesn't interrupt you). To recap...</p>

<h2 id="10-build-1128">1.0 (Build 1128)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2018-05-14</em></p>
<p>This build DOES include: signing in with Firefox Accounts to see your real "Saved Logins" data from Firefox; automatic locking with biometrics (Touch ID / Face ID) to prevent access to your data; searching and sorting items; showing/hiding passwords; copying usernames and passwords to the pasteboard (which expire after 60 seconds); opening web addresses in your preferred web browser; Telemetry for event tracking (no personally-identifiable information is collected).</p>
<p>This build DOES NOT include: user-friendly item titles (#193); links to real FAQ content (#172 and #340); proper visual placeholders when an initial sync is occurring (#233) or when no items are found (#44).</p>
<p>Some KNOWN ISSUES include: you may sign in and get a "confirmation" email, the app doesn't tell you that you need to go find that email so your list appears empty - go find that email and "Confirm" your sign ins, please (#328); the autolock timer doesn't automatically lock your app (#356); when navigating away from the list view and a sync occurs in the background the app will pop you back into the list view (#347); the search/filter keyboard is immediately dismissed after the first and second character you type (#351). Don't worry, we'll get these fixed soon!</p>
<p>Please also note: the app may crash on first run â€” just open it again and please let us know if you encounter this or anything unexpected. We believe we squashed all kinds of bugs related to first run and sign in but need your help making sure.</p>
<h2 id="10-build-742">1.0 (Build 742)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2018-04-24</em></p>
<p>This build includes: sign in with Firefox Accounts, sign out to "lock", search and sort items, show/hide passwords, copy username and password to pasteboard (expires after 60 seconds), open web addresses in preferred web browser.</p>
<p>This build does NOT include: actual Sync data (test data only), Face ID nor Touch ID biometrics to unlock, onboarding instructions, FAQ content.</p>
<p>Please note: the only data loaded into the app is hard-coded test data (not real Sync data)</p>
